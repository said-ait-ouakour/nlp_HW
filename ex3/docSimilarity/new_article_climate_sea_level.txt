The effects of climate change on sea levels are a major concern for scientists and policymakers around the world. Climate change is causing the Earth's temperature to rise, which is melting glaciers and ice sheets. This melting is causing sea levels to rise. The rise in sea levels is already having a significant impact on coastal communities around the world. It is causing flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. The effects of climate change on sea levels are expected to become more severe in the future.
